Mechanical staff will remove the doublet from the machine tonight and leave it in the synchrotron. Work will begin tomorrow morning on a repair. This will entail removing the creen from the doublet, manufacturing a new screen by machining a stock screen so that it fits the doublet, installing new screen in the doublet then inserting the doublet back onto the machine.\n",

Theres a small chance that if things go well tomorrow, they may be able to assemble the screen in the morning, get it into the synch, get it into the doublet and get it all back together by late tomorrow evening.

The problem was tracked between Substation 14 & 15 on site, SSE were working on Harwell site and managed to reset the breakers but sufficient time off has caused the water systems to fail and therefore most of ISIS is off.\n",

The solkor should not have operated unless it saw an issue with the cable section between the substations. No work was being carried out in this room where the CB tripped and there was also no current being injected onto the other half of the board at the time of the event. Currently the reason for the trip is unknown.\n",

Losing around 75-100 litres and hour, by far the highest leak rate in 6 months on EPICS data. Coupled with an earth leakage trip on R5QTF and a BLM monitor in SP5 that drifts around even after chagning the card in the inner, I have decided send crew in to the outer to investigate. The cameras cannot see the area. \n",

R0BLM3 is fine at injection, messy from 0.5ms onwards. losses at R1blm3 and R2BLM3 are high at injection. Tried moving foil position, tank phases but all is good. HEDS scan shows PM13 at -1.5 which seams low but the losses at R0BLM3 are on reference. Tried moving extract septum 10A either way, seams a bit suspect that the loss is around the septum area at injection. \n",

Nothing obvious, looks like the 2 state issue from a previous user run. Adjusted the vertical orbit to move and reduce the loss around SP5, Beam back to MS and they will keep looking for an issue next week. |\n",

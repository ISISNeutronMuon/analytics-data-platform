# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-07-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
It is recommended to use the lightweight [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) by Nat Pryce.
We avoid the heavier weight formats such as [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) as there are not yet any collaborators
to inform as this is a proof of concept run by a single engineer.

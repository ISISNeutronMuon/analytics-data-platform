`Apache Superset <apache-superset_>`_ is a data exploration and visualization tool,
allowing users to create charts and dashboards to explore data.
It is an off-the-shelf, open-source tool used extensively by the analytics community

ISIS hosts its own `instance of this tool <isis-superset_>`_ with the available
:ref:`data sets <data-catalog>` preconfigured.

# Data Platform Proof-of-Concept

## Introduction

After requirements gathering meetings and a workshop as part of the
[accelerator operational data platform project](https://stfc365.sharepoint.com/sites/ISISProject-1432)
there is appetite for trialling a system to support long-term storage, complex
queries and analysis of data from a multitude of sources across the accelerator
data space.

This document describes the initial set of requirements along with an overview
of the design and implementation of a minimal system to prove
the [Data Lakehouse](https://stfc365-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/martyn_gigg_stfc_ac_uk/ETTFvkI6FulFhQFWmrmfGosBRO1Syvqbiq6DhVwnqxhVbw?e=HNKUIl)
concept can be valuable to ISIS.
